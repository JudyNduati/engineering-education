### Introduction

In today's world, every company has various sets of applications and systems. Subsystems and components are assembled and merged to function as one system. Connecting these systems is a business requirement that smart enterprises have already adopted. It is great to bring ERP, CRM, e-commerce, POS, inventory management, and other applications under a single interface. Integrating these technologies and systems is not easy. It is a challenge IT persons often face in their companies. This article looks at system integration challenges. Also, you will learn the practices needed to overcome system integration challenges.

### System Integration

Integration is merging two or more components and subsystems into one system.

For Example, the linking of a keyboard, CPU, monitor, and mouse forms a desktop computer system.

[System Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#:~:text=System%20integration%20involves%20integrating%20existing,costs%20and%20improving%20response%20time).) is merging all physical and virtual components of an organization's system. The physical components comprise machine systems, inventory, hardware, etc.

The virtual components include data that is stored in databases, software's and applications. The purpose of integrating these components is so that they function as a single system. We need system integration mainly to exchange data between two or more systems.

Organizations integrate their systems is to improve their operations' productivity and quality. System integration enables IT systems to talk to each other. Thus speeding up information flows and reduce operating costs. System integration connects the internal structures of an organization. It also connects third parties the organization works with.

Here are methods of system integration:

- [Vertical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration)
- [Star integration (spaghetti integration)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#:~:text=Star%20integration%2C%20also%20known%20as,each%20of%20the%20remaining%20subsystems.&amp;text=This%20allows%20cutting%20the%20costs%20of%20integration%20and%20provides%20extreme%20flexibility.)
- [Horizontal integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_integration#:~:text=Horizontal%20integration%20is%20the%20process,for%20that%20product%20or%20service.)

### Importance of System Integration

System integration is essential because it links, automates, and optimize business processes within the company and outside the company firewall. System integration enables enterprises to achieve a competitive advantage. This is due to improved automation, customer satisfaction, inventory optimization, and real-time visibility.

If components and programs do not integrate. It becomes difficult for employees to work effectively. Having your data and resources under one central location reduces costs, time, and storage space. Suppose your systems and processes do not work together. It can be challenging and time-consuming to manage everything individually. Integrating your processes leads to efficiency, effectiveness, and reduction of time and cost.

### System Integration Challenges

Despite the advantages it offers to many organizations. There are challenges system integration challenges. These problems increase the workload and decrease the overall quality of the system leading to failure. Cost increases, and a lot of time is spent solving the problems.

In software development, the integration phase is considered to be one of the most challenging stages. Integration challenges remain hidden at the initial stages of the project and get noticed towards the project completion. Integration challenges in software development occur due to:

- Components needed for integration may not be ready according to the planned schedule.
- Components may not be well defined.
- The environment may not be well prepared for integration.

The complexity of systems integration gives rise to many challenges to system integrators and developers. While integrating a system, unpredicted, unforeseen, and unplanned issues arise. Here are some of the most common challenges in system integration.

#### Monolithic systems

Many enterprises have [monolithic architecture systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_system#:~:text=A%20software%20system%20is%20called,than%20containing%20architecturally%20separate%20components.). Therefore, it is not possible to do away with those systems efficiently. Organizations heavily depend on monolithic systems, as they are mostly [legacy systems](https://www.youredi.com/blog/legacy-system-integration). Replacing these systems for the sake of integration is difficult. Thus it becomes a challenge.

#### Choosing the right tool for integration

There are many tools in the market giving assurance to offer the best integration experience. It is challenging to know which tool is excellent in terms of speed of integration, functionality, and cost. The chosen tool should allow the smooth integration of on-premise and cloud-based applications.

#### Lack of accountability

There may be multiple stakeholders such as vendors, system integrators, system developers, and system owners, and none is responsible for the full system integration. The shareholders handle their side of integration well but will not go outside their territory. The accountability for the success of integration becomes unclear. When something goes wrong during integration, parties blame each other, making it a challenge. If one party handles system integration, the party is responsible for the whole project and its success. There is no ambiguity over accountability.

#### Lack of skilled resources

System integration needs expertise or skill that is rare among most IT persons. Having an outstanding integration technology is not enough if the required knowledge and skill are not there. It is difficult for most companies to find and retain employees with the expertise required for system integration. Most enterprises go for external third-party providers who have the needed integration expertise.

#### Cost of integration

Integration is expensive. Therefore integration cost becomes a challenge. There is cost related to system maintenance, customization, system upgrading, system license, training, and other processes.

#### Constant changes of the integration landscape

The higher the intensity of the problem, the longer the system integration project takes. Time is of importance to manage the risk.

When system integration projects are short, the success rate of the project is improved.

#### Different business units see data differently.

Businesses are different and see data differently because their operational responsibilities are not alike. Companies use different systems and applications to exchange data. It is a challenge because the system integrator needs to focus more on data modeling to integrate successfully.

### Success Factors for System Integration

Better planning, monitoring, and control help to minimize integration problems. These practices help to overcome system integration challenges,

#### Keep your system simple.

Systems work well and effectively when they are simple rather than when they are complex. When integrating systems, use the [KISS (Keep it simple stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle. Do not risk using the [big design upfront (BDUF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front) development because of the level of complexity. To be safe, break it down and build what you need when you want it. Through this, you will be able to overcome system integration challenges.

#### Consider Automation

When integrating a system, take time figuring out how to avoid human intervention. The world is growing at a tremendous rate, and everything is going digital. When you automate your processes, your business becomes better. The most exciting thing is getting your job done within the shortest time and with few or no faults.

#### Go for smaller integrations over extensive integrations.

Small and straightforward integrations are more powerful. They hardly create any dependencies than large and complicated solutions.

#### Choose a system integration tool that allows you to maintain or change with ease.

There are several system integration tools you could use to automate and integrate processes. The tools also help with data synchronization and integrating workflows.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, system integration is complex. Therefore, you need to understand system integration well and how it works. In this article, we learned what system integration is. How important it is, its challenges, and how to overcome those challenges. I hope this article will shed some light and give you an understanding of system integration.
